                Battle Ship is a command line game made entirely with Python. The goal was to emulate the classic HasbroÂ® game of the same name. I created a simple AI that a person could play against, two game boards to monitor the ships, and a generator to randomly place hidden ships on the boards at the start of the game. Players alternate turns until all the opponents ships have been destroyed.

                While the game may not be as feature rich as the original, it is still challenging, and offers a nerve racking race to find enemy ships.
